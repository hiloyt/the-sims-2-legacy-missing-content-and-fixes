# the-sims-2-legacy-missing-content-and-fixes
This is where you can learn how to restore the Ikea SP to The Sims 2 Legacy, restore missing music or song tracks from the radio, and learn a few other helpful fixes!

# List of fixes

1. IKEA SP restored [is back](https://github.com/hiloyt/the-sims-2-legacy-ikea)!
2. Missing songs [restored](#missing-songs)
3. Missing Holiday items [restored](#missing-holiday-items)

## The Sims 2: IKEA Home Stuff is back!

You can find a detailed tutorial on restoring `IKEA` SP to `The Sims 2 Legacy` under this [link](https://github.com/hiloyt/the-sims-2-legacy-ikea).

## Missing songs
Due to expired licenses, several music tracks have been permanently removed from The Sims 2 Legacy.

If you still have those expansions or are a lucky owner of `The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection`, you can quickly restore them!
The process is tedious, involving copying/pasting from one place to another. But hey, you can have all your favourite songs back in the game soon!

Here, you can find the SOURCE and DESTINATION locations of files that you need to replace. The included list is from `The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection`, so it can differ slightly in disk edition/older releases. But you still can use EP/SP names to figure it out! :)

### 1. EP1 - CollegeRock.package

The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection\University Life\EP1\TSData\Res\Sound

## Missing Holiday items
The situation with this mini pack is precisely the same as in `The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection` - EA used old files for this mini pack with `Legacy Edition`, so some items are missing.

Here is [the link](https://sunradersims.wordpress.com/2020/11/25/fix-for-missing-holiday-items/) to the fix and attached files.

But in our case, paths are a little different:
1. `H05.bundle.package` > `The Sims 2 Legacy Collection\Base\TSData\Res\Catalog\Bins`
2. `Skins.package` > `The Sims 2 Legacy Collection\Base\TSData\Res\Catalog\Skins`
